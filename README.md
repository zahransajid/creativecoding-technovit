## The premise
Using python and the Blender python API, Conway's game of life, a classic example of cellular automata was extended to 3 dimensions.
In addition, consecutive generations of automota were created side by side to help understand temporal progression.
[This](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/3D-Conways-Game-of-Life) API was used to generate the 3D matrix.
