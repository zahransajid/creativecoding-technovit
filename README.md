## The premise
Using python and the Blender python API, Conway's game of life, a classic example of cellular automata was extended to 3 dimensions.
In addition, consecutive generations of automota were created side by side to help understand temporal progression.
[This](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/3D-Conways-Game-of-Life) API was used to generate the 3D matrix.

## Additional materials
The powerpoint presentation accompanying the presentation is in the root directory.
Some example renders can be found under the `/renders` directory.

To simply explore the code and its results, try `/conway/conway_simple.blend` as it contains just the code and results.

The obj files generated can be found under `/conway`.

## How to run it
Open a [Blender](https://blender.org) window, import the scripts present in `/conway`.

Make sure they have the same name as the `.py` file.
Run the `generate` file and the result should be generated.

You can edit, add materials or modify parameters as required.
